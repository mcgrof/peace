# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## One commit per change

As with the Linux kernel, this project prefers commits to be atomic and to
the point. We don't want spell fixes to be blended in with code changes.
Spell fixes should go into separate commits. When in doubt, just don't do
any spell fixes unless asked explicitly to do that.

## Use the Signed-off-by tag

We want to use the Signed-off-by tag which embodies the application of the
Developer Certificate or Origin.

## Use Generated-by: Claude AI

Use this tag for code generated by Claude code AI. Put this before the
Signed-off-by tag.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULE**: When using "Generated-by: Claude AI", it MUST be
immediately followed by the "Signed-off-by:" tag with NO empty lines between them.
These two lines must be consecutive.

Correct format:
```
Subject line

Detailed description of changes...

Generated-by: Claude AI
Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@example.com>
```

**WRONG** - Do NOT add empty lines between Generated-by and Signed-off-by:
```
Generated-by: Claude AI

Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@example.com>
```

**WRONG** - Do NOT add extra empty lines:
```
Generated-by: Claude AI


Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@example.com>
```

## Avoid Shopping cart lists

Generative AI seems to like to make commit logs long itemized lists of things
it did. This is stupid. This should be avoided. It is creating very silly
commit logs. Use plain english and get to the point. Be as clear a possible
and get to the point of not what you want to communicate, but rather what
will make a reviewer easily understand what the heck you are implementing.

You should *think* hard about your commit log, always.
